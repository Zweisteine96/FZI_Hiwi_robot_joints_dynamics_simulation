# FZI_Hiwi_robot_joints_dynamics_simulation
## Task: 
* Simulating the robot joints dynamics.

## Basic idea: 
* Creating a ros node to simulate the joints behavior of a robot.
* Using a standard ros controller to control the node.

## Goal:
* By specifying the number of joints and the dynamic model parameters, the node can be adapted to any kind of robot in a flexible way, even without the full dynamic model of the robot.
